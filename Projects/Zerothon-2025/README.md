- **SQLite3**
- **JWT Authentication**

### AI & APIs

---

## 💻 My Role

### 1️⃣ Frontend Development

**Main Dashboard (`index.html`)**:
- Arranged team members' progress, To-Do lists, and AI analysis results on one screen
- Intuitive UI/UX design (progress bars, color-based status differentiation)

**Report Writing Page (`report.html`)**:
- Structured input form for "What I did yesterday", "What I'll do today", "Issues"
- Dynamic to-do checklist (add/delete functionality)

**Overall Frontend Design**:
- Collaborated with another team member to handle overall UI/UX
- Core philosophy: "User-friendly UI/UX" (not showing off capabilities)
- Actively utilized familiar patterns like Google login button

**Technical Constraints and Learning**:
- First real project - no experience with frameworks like React, Vue
- Implemented dynamic UI using only pure JS/HTML/CSS
- Realized efficiency differences without frameworks → Started learning React afterward

---

### 2️⃣ Team Leader Role

**Team Composition**: 3 Frontend + 2 Backend developers (large skill gap)

**Role-Customized Distribution**:
- Skilled members: Focused on core feature development
- Beginner members: Research, design drafts - roles that enable growth
- Coordinated so everyone could contribute while leveraging their strengths

**Conflict Resolution**:
- Situation: Emotional friction during meeting time coordination before Zerothon
- Solution: Individual opinion listening → Objective criteria readjustment → Team goal reminder

**Leadership Philosophy**: "Not pulling from the front, but pushing from behind"

---

### 3️⃣ Presenter Role

**Presentation Order**: 18th out of 19 teams (very disadvantageous position)

**Presentation Strategy**:
1. Opening: "What is our team doing?" - Built empathy with three words
2. Core Message: Problem empathy → Solution presentation → Actual demonstration
3. Presentation Philosophy: "Make as many audience members listen to my story for as long as possible"

**Result**: Achieved 1st place in presentation score

---

## 🤝 Team Collaboration and Git

**Current Commit History Situation**:
- One team member uploaded all code in a `final commit`
- Almost no individual commit records (I only recorded README writing)

**Actual Development Process**:
- Local development → Offline integration → Final batch commit
- Insufficient Git branching strategy knowledge at the time

**Actual Contributions**:
- Main dashboard and report writing form UI/UX design/implementation
- Set overall frontend design direction
- Team scheduling coordination and role distribution
- Final presentation and PPT creation

**Learning Point**: Git branching strategy essential for team collaboration → Applied PR-based collaboration in subsequent projects

---

## 💡 Lessons Learned

### Technical Learning

**Necessity of Frameworks**:
- Experienced implementing dynamic UI with pure JS
- Felt inefficiency through manually writing DOM manipulation/event handling
- Started learning React afterward

**Importance of Git Collaboration**:
- Learned branching strategy, Pull Requests, commit message conventions

**Importance of Design**:
- No matter how good the features, complex UI/UX gets ignored
- Importance of utilizing familiar patterns

---

### Leadership and Collaboration

**Leader Who Pushes from Behind**:
- Pulling from front makes team members passive, pushing from behind makes them proactive
- Give meaningful roles even to less capable team members

**Courage to Be Disliked**:
- Leader must step up when team direction is wrong
- Can't satisfy everyone, but must protect team goals

---

### Presentation Skills

**Maintaining Audience Focus**:
- Opening impact: 3-word empathy building
- Storytelling: Problem → Solution → Demonstration
- Direct demonstration of completed product

---

### Learning Approach Shift

**Bottom-up → Top-down**:
- Before: Starting from theory step by step (slow and boring)
- After: Making actual products and finding gaps (fast and enjoyable)

**Importance of Completion**:
- 100% completed product beats 80% idea
- Must implement to actually usable level to gain recognition

**Why Our Team Won the Award**:
1. Completion: Full frontend-backend integration
2. Presentation: Storytelling that captivated the audience
3. Practicality: Actually usable service

---

## 🚀 Subsequent Impact

After this project:
- Started learning React (realized need for frameworks)
- Improved Git collaboration methods (branching strategy, PR)
- Established Top-down learning approach (project-centered)
- Gained confidence in team projects

**Currently**:
- Backend + AI developer in QuantrumAI project
- Full-stack development with Django + React combination
- Leading project leveraging team leader experience

## ❓ Expected Interview Questions

### Q1: There are almost no contribution records in the Git commit history. Did you actually develop it?

**A**: Yes, absolutely. At the time, we developed in an offline collaboration-focused manner, and since we didn't know Git branching strategies, one team member committed the final code all at once. In reality, I designed/implemented the UI/UX for the main dashboard and report writing form, coordinated the schedule as team leader, and handled the final presentation. This experience made me realize the importance of Git collaboration, and I applied branching strategies and PR-based collaboration in subsequent projects.

---

### Q2: Why did you develop with only pure JS without frameworks?

**A**: Because it was my first real project and I didn't know frameworks. While directly implementing DOM manipulation and event handling gave me deep understanding of JavaScript principles, I felt limitations in code reusability and maintainability. After realizing why frameworks are necessary, I immediately started learning React, and now I develop efficiently while understanding internal principles thanks to my pure JS experience.

---

### Q3: What was the most difficult part as team leader and how did you solve it?

**A**: The large skill gap among team members was the most challenging. I assigned core feature development to skilled members and meaningful roles like research or design drafts to beginners. I learned that a leader "doesn't pull from the front but pushes from behind," and that the key is leveraging each person's strengths while compensating for weaknesses as a team.

---

### Q4: Why did you choose the opening "What is our team doing?"?

**A**: As the 18th presentation out of 19 teams, I expected the audience's focus to be at its lowest. I summarized a problem experienced in all team projects into 3 words to build empathy and focused attention with a short, powerful question. As a result, I received 1st place in presentation score, and the judges evaluated it as a "memorable presentation."

---

### Q5: What area did you grow most in through this project?

**A**: I grew in three areas. First, technically, implementing the frontend with pure JS made me realize the need for frameworks, leading to expansion of my tech stack with React and Django. Second, in collaboration skills, I learned the importance of Git strategy and how to lead teams with skill differences. Third, my learning approach shifted from Bottom-up (theory first) to Top-down (project first), allowing me to learn much more efficiently and enjoyably.
