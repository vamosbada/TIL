---

## =» My Role

### 1ã Frontend Development

**Main Dashboard (`index.html`)**:
- Displayed team member progress, To-Do lists, and AI analysis results on one screen
- Intuitive UI/UX design (progress bars, color-coded status indicators)

**Report Writing Page (`report.html`)**:
- Structured input forms for "What I did yesterday", "What I'll do today", "Issues"
- Dynamic task checklist (add/delete functionality)

**Overall Frontend Design**:
- Collaborated with team members on entire UI/UX
- Core philosophy: "User-friendly UI/UX" (not showing off skills)
- Actively utilized familiar patterns like Google login button

**Technical Constraints and Learning**:
- First real project - no experience with React, Vue, or other frameworks
- Implemented dynamic UI with pure JS/HTML/CSS only
- Realized frameworks are possible without but felt the efficiency difference ’ Started learning React afterward

---

### 2ã Team Leader Role

**Team Composition**: 3 Frontend + 2 Backend (large skill gap)

**Role-based Distribution**:
- Skilled members: Focus on core feature development
- Beginner members: Research, design drafts, and growth-oriented roles
- Coordinated so everyone could contribute while utilizing their strengths

**Conflict Resolution**:
- Situation: Emotional friction during meeting time coordination the day before Zerothon
- Solution: Individual opinion gathering ’ Objective criteria readjustment ’ Team goal reminder

**Leadership Philosophy**: "Not pulling from the front, but pushing from behind"

---

### 3ã Presenter Role

**Presentation Order**: 18th out of 19 teams (very disadvantageous position)

**Presentation Strategy**:
1. Opening: "What's our team doing?" - Three words creating empathy
2. Core message: Problem empathy ’ Solution presentation ’ Live demo
3. Presentation philosophy: "Make as many audience members listen for as long as possible"

**Result**: Achieved 1st place in presentation score

---

## > Team Collaboration and Git

**Current Commit History Situation**:
- One team member uploaded all code with `final commit`
- Almost no individual commit records (mine shows only README edits)

**Actual Development Process**:
- Local development ’ Offline integration ’ Final batch commit
- Immature Git branching strategy at the time

**Actual Contributions**:
- Main dashboard and report form UI/UX design/implementation
- Overall frontend design direction
- Team schedule coordination and role distribution
- Final presentation and PPT creation

**Learning Point**: Git branching strategy essential for team collaboration ’ Applied PR-based collaboration in later projects

---

## =¡ Lessons Learned

### Technical Learning

**Need for Frameworks**:
- Experience implementing dynamic UI with pure JS
- Felt inefficiency while manually writing DOM manipulation/event handling
- Started learning React afterward

**Importance of Git Collaboration**:
- Learned branching strategy, Pull Requests, commit message conventions

**Importance of Design**:
- Even great features get ignored if UI/UX is complex
- Importance of utilizing familiar patterns

---

### Leadership and Collaboration

**Leader Who Pushes from Behind**:
- Pulling from front makes team passive, pushing from behind makes them proactive
- Give meaningful roles even to less capable members

**Courage to Be Disliked**:
- Leader must step up when team direction goes wrong
- Can't satisfy everyone but must protect team goals

---

### Presentation Skills

**Maintaining Audience Focus**:
- Opening impact: 3-word empathy creation
- Storytelling: Problem ’ Solution ’ Demo
- Direct demonstration of finished product

---

### Shift in Learning Approach

**Bottom-up ’ Top-down**:
- Before: Theory first, step by step (slow and boring)
- After: Build actual product while finding gaps (fast and enjoyable)

**Importance of Completion**:
- 100% finished product beats 80% ideas
- Must implement to actually usable level to gain recognition

**Why Our Team Won**:
1. Completion: Full frontend-backend integration
2. Presentation: Storytelling that captivated audience
3. Practicality: Actually usable service

---

## =€ Impact Afterward

After this project:
- Started learning React (felt framework necessity)
- Improved Git collaboration (branching strategy, PR)
- Established Top-down learning (project-centered)
- Gained team project confidence

**Current**:
- Backend + AI role in QuantrumAI project
- Full-stack development with Django + React
- Project leadership utilizing team leader experience

## S Interview Prep Questions

### Q1: Your Git commit history shows almost no contributions. Did you actually develop?

**A**: Yes, I did. We developed with offline collaboration focus and didn't know Git branching strategy, so one team member batch-committed the final code. Actually, I designed/implemented the main dashboard and report form UI/UX, coordinated schedules as team leader, and handled the final presentation. This experience taught me the importance of Git collaboration, and I've applied branching strategy and PR-based collaboration in subsequent projects.

---

### Q2: Why did you develop with pure JS without frameworks?

**A**: It was my first real project and I didn't know frameworks. Implementing DOM manipulation and event handling directly helped me deeply understand JavaScript internals, but I felt limitations in code reusability and maintainability. After experiencing why frameworks are needed, I immediately started learning React, and now I develop efficiently while understanding internal principles thanks to pure JS experience.

---

### Q3: What was most difficult as team leader and how did you solve it?

**A**: The large skill gap among team members was most challenging. I assigned core feature development to skilled members and meaningful roles like research or design drafts to beginners. I learned that leaders should "push from behind, not pull from front," and that leveraging individual strengths while compensating weaknesses as a team is key.

---

### Q4: Why did you choose "What's our team doing?" as the opening?

**A**: As the 18th presenter out of 19 teams, I expected audience focus to be at its lowest. I summarized a problem all team projects face in three words to create empathy and grabbed attention with a short, powerful question. This resulted in 1st place in presentation score, and judges evaluated it as a "memorable presentation."

---

### Q5: What area did you grow most through this project?

**A**: I grew in three areas. First, technically I realized the need for frameworks by implementing frontend with pure JS, expanding my tech stack to React and Django. Second, in collaboration I learned the importance of Git strategy and how to lead teams with skill gaps. Third, my learning approach shifted from Bottom-up (theory first) to Top-down (project first), making learning much more efficient and enjoyable.
